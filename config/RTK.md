# RTK — Rust Token Killer

**Usage**: Token-optimized CLI proxy (60-90% savings on dev operations)

## Meta Commands (always use rtk directly)

```bash
rtk gain              # Show token savings analytics
rtk gain --history    # Show command usage history with savings
rtk discover          # Analyze Claude Code history for missed opportunities
rtk proxy <cmd>       # Execute raw command without filtering (for debugging)
```

## Installation Verification

```bash
rtk --version         # Should show: rtk X.Y.Z
rtk gain              # Should work (not "command not found")
which rtk             # Verify correct binary path
```

⚠️ **Name collision**: If `rtk gain` fails, you may have `reachingforthejack/rtk` (Rust Type Kit) installed instead of RTK (Rust Token Killer). They are different tools with the same binary name.

## Hook-Based Usage

All bash commands are automatically rewritten by the Claude Code PreToolUse hook.
Example: `git status` → `rtk git status` (transparent, 0 tokens overhead)

The hook is configured in `~/.claude/settings.json`:
```json
"PreToolUse": [
  {
    "matcher": "Bash",
    "hooks": [{ "type": "command", "command": "rtk hook claude" }]
  }
]
```

Refer to CLAUDE.md for full command reference.
